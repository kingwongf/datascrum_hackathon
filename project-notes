Which strategies did we research?
Looked at the REIT location sciences, but only visits data was daily (monthly is only 14 data pts - not enough to dev model and backtest.
Best data we found was 
Decided to augment a pairs trading model, by overlaying analyst expectations vs earnings to mitigate equity specific spikes from surprises

To do:
p&l with our model vs just pairs vs buy & hold vs s&p

Update backtesting for % returns

Explain our model: 
We identified highly correlated pairs using daily close price to generate a correlation map

comparing 100d moving average with 200d moving average to signal anticipated errors in earnings consensus which augments
and improves our pairs trading model (need to explain why comparing 100 v 200d might be a good signal)

Anthony:
  Start PPT
  Think of weird alt data to add to model (look through what they've provided)
  
Book: thinking fast and slow
